Exodus Autonomous Rocket 5 (Exo-A-R-5)

THe Exo-A-R-5 is an experimental vehicle to test and refine the new SCS3 System 


Primary Goals.
1. Demonstrate SCS3.
2. Upgrade SCS to V3 
3. Upgrade Launch System
4. Create Primary System Escape system



Launches:
1. Empty tanks - costs K6930.
    Some science was collected.
    Recoved 6930 funds.


2. Added a little solid fuel.
    Added two parachutes - cost K8930 (not sure why two K400 chutes caused the price to go up by K2000) (maybe the fuel)
    We want to test if the two chutes can carry the entire empty ship, or if we need to seperate.

    The ship unexpectedly launched itself, there may have been a software issue, we are unsure. And it performed the first stage separation.

    The ship can land safely without the solidfuel boosters.

    Recovered K6875 funds.


3. Redid test 2 after making sure that the main program have no launch code in it.
    Cost K8981

    Confirmed it was a software issue, the 0.ks was not saved, and thus old version was run, which started the launch.

    With both chutes deployed the ship was able to savely land without any seperations.
    
    Recoved K8752 funds, which is very nice.


Now the test vehicle is ready, we can start upgrading the SCS from V2 to V3, although some of the changes have already started, such as renaming files.

4. Lots of launchpad 'launches' during the development of SCS3.
    No funds used.
    SCS3 Created, and manually tested.
